Applied Data Science — Models, Theory, and Practice

This repository contains a collection of data science notebooks focused on
machine learning models and their theoretical foundations.

The projects emphasize understanding *why* a model works,
not just how to run it.

## 🎯 Scope of this repository

This repository is centered around:
- Python notebooks
- machine learning models
- statistical and mathematical foundations
- clear theoretical explanations with formulas

The goal is to connect:
- theory
- implementation
- interpretation

rather than treating ML as a black box.

## 🧪 Primary Use Case — Credit Scoring

The main dataset used in this repository is related to **credit scoring**.

The objective is to model and assess credit risk by:
- predicting default probability
- understanding the drivers of risk
- evaluating model performance and stability

This use case is well-suited for:
- binary classification
- probability estimation
- model interpretability
- real-world constraints

## 📈 Modeling Approach

Typical topics covered include:
- logistic regression
- feature selection
- probability theory and statistics
- model evaluation metrics (AUC, KS, confusion matrix, etc.)
- bias, variance, and regularization
- interpretation of coefficients and decision boundaries

Formulas and theoretical concepts are explicitly detailed to ensure
a solid understanding of the models.

## 📊 From theory to implementation

Each notebook generally follows this structure:
1. problem formulation
2. theoretical background
3. data exploration
4. model implementation
5. evaluation and interpretation
6. discussion of limitations

## 🧰 Tools & Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Statistics & probability
- Jupyter notebooks

---

## 🧭 Positioning

This repository complements **analytics engineering** by focusing on:
- modeling and inference
- statistical reasoning
- machine learning foundations

It is intentionally notebook-centric and theory-oriented.

## 📜 Philosophy

A model without understanding is just noise.

Data science starts with theory and ends with interpretation.
